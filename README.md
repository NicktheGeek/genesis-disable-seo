Disables Genesis SEO.

## Description

Genesis will automatically turn off it's own SEO when a few other SEO plugins are active. If an unsupported SEO plugin is used, this requires users to modify theme files. Instead, this plugin uses a single line of PHP to disable Genesis SEO. This is the simplest and safest way to turn off Genesis SEO.
